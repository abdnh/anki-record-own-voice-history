This changes the behavior of  the reviewer's "Record Own Voice" option in the following ways:
<ul><li>Recordings are saved to the <b>add-on's folder</b> and a GUI is provided to play or delete each card's recordings.</li><li>Pressing V to replay own voice plays the most recent recording associated with the current card if any.</li></ul>

I find this useful to quickly record my pronunciation and track my progress between reviews without having to edit the notes to add the sounds each time.
